# RenalDosing
The repository is for building an Rshiny application to help physicians to prescribe drugs appropriately in patients with impaired renal function. 
As a first step, a physcian determines renal function status of his/her patient. Then the physician queries for appropriate dosing of a drug based on renal function status of the patient.
